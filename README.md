# IP Tracker

IP Tracker created with React.JS, Leaflet API (https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html) and IP Geolocation API (https://geo.ipify.org/).

## General Information

This project is a IP Tracker created for Frontend Mentor: 
https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0

This is my second project created using React.JS.

## Features

- Displays location of your IP Address on load
- Interactive map
- Ability to search for information about any IP adress or domain name
- Works on mobile devices

## Project Status

Project is complete.

## Room for Improvement

- Sometimes information might grow out of its container
- Marker on map is not the prettiest 
- Fetching is a bit messy
- On mobile devices the whole layout gets destroyed while trying to use input

### To sum up

This project is not polished and not perfect, however my goal was mainly to practice interacting with API's and that works well.
